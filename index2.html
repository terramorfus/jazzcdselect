        <p>Ambitious, atonal, challenging -- all are accurate descriptions of "Dimensions & Extensions", Sam Rivers'
            fourth album for Blue Note, recorded at the Van Gelder Studio in 1967. Rivers remains grounded in hard
            bop
            structure, working with a sextet featuring Donald Byrd (trumpet), James Spaulding (alto saxophone,
            flute),
            Julian Priester (trombone), Cecil McBee (bass), and Steve Ellington (drums), but he explodes the
            boundaries
            of the form with difficult, dissonant compositions. With his unique, mercurial tone and edgy solos, he
            keeps
            pushing the sextet in different directions. It's intense, cerebral music, but since it has distinct
            themes
            and strong rhythms, the forays into free jazz, dissonant harmonies, and unpredictable tonal textures are
            actually quite accessible. Rivers simply burns on each track, whether playing tenor, soprano, or flute.
            Byrd
            doesn't display the wild imagination of Rivers, yet he keeps the pace with alternately languid and
            biting
            solos. Similarly, each of the remaining musicians makes a lasting impression with his individual time in
            the
            spotlight. With music as risky at this, it's forgivable that it occasionally meanders (especially on the
            slower numbers) but, overall, Dimensions & Extensions offers more proof that Sam Rivers was one of the
            early
            giants of the avant-garde.

    <div class="description">
        <p>Recorded at the Van Gelder Studio in 1964, "Out to Lunch" stands as Eric Dolphy's magnum opus, an
            absolute
            pinnacle of avant-garde jazz in any form or era. Its rhythmic complexity was perhaps unrivaled since
            Dave
            Brubeck's Time Out, and its five Dolphy originals -- the jarring Monk tribute "Hat and Beard," the
            aptly
            titled "Something Sweet, Something Tender," the weirdly jaunty flute showcase "Gazzelloni," the
            militaristic
            title track, the drunken lurch of "Straight Up and Down" -- were a perfect balance of structured
            frameworks,
            carefully calibrated timbres, and generous individual freedom. Much has been written about Dolphy's
            odd time
            signatures, wide-interval leaps, and flirtations with atonality. And those preoccupations reach
            their peak
            on Out to Lunch, which is less rooted in bop tradition than anything Dolphy had ever done. But that
            sort of
            analytical description simply doesn't do justice to the utterly alien effect of the album's jagged
            soundscapes. Dolphy uses those pet devices for their evocative power and unnerving hints of
            dementia, not
            some abstract intellectual exercise. His solos and themes aren't just angular and dissonant --
            they're
            hugely so, with a definite playfulness that becomes more apparent with every listen. The whole
            ensemble --
            trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, vibist Bobby Hutcherson, bassist Richard Davis, and drummer Tony Williams
            --
            takes full advantage of the freedom Dolphy offers, but special mention has to be made of Hutcherson,
            who has
            fully perfected his pianoless accompaniment technique. His creepy, floating chords and quick stabs
            of
            dissonance anchor the album's texture, and he punctuates the soloists' lines at the least expected
            times,
            suggesting completely different pulses. Meanwhile, Dolphy's stuttering vocal-like effects and oddly
            placed
            pauses often make his bass clarinet lines sound like they're tripping over themselves. Just as the
            title Out
            to Lunch suggests, this is music that sounds like nothing so much as a mad gleam in its creator's
            eyes.

        <div class="description">
            <p>One of the New Thing's extremely few trombonists and a greatly underappreciated composer of
                tremendous
                evocative power, Grachan Moncur III got his first major exposure on Jackie McLean's
                groundbreaking 1963
                masterpiece, "One Step Beyond". Toward the end of the year, most of the same musicians
                reconvened for
                Moncur's debut as a leader, "Evolution", recorded at the Van Gelder Studio in 1963. ;
                McLean, vibist
                Bobby Hutcherson, and drummer Tony Williams are all back, with Bob Cranshaw on bass and an
                extra voice
                in trumpeter Lee Morgan, moonlighting from his usual groovy hard bop style. While Moncur
                takes a little
                more solo space here, the main emphasis is on his talent as a composer. The four originals
                are all
                extended, multi-sectioned works (the shortest is around eight minutes), all quite ambitious,
                and all
                terrifically moody; much of the album sounds sinister and foreboding, and even the brighter
                material has
                a twisted, surreal fun-house undercurrent. Part of that is due to the accuracy with which
                the musicians
                interpret Moncur's vision. Hutcherson provides his trademark floating chordal accompaniment,
                which is
                crucial to the overall texture; what's more, the album features some of McLean's weirdest
                playing ever,
                and some of Morgan's most impressively advanced, as he makes the most of a situation he
                longed to be in
                more often. Of the pieces, "Monk in Wonderland" is the most memorable; its whimsical,
                angular theme is
                offset by Hutcherson's mysterious vibes, which create a trippy effect in keeping with the
                title. "Air
                Raid" is alternately ominous and terrifyingly frantic, and the funereal title track keeps
                time only in
                the pulse of the horns and the backing, which is based entirely on whole notes. With such an
                inventive
                debut, it's a shame Moncur didn't record more as a leader, which makes Evolution an even
                more important
                item for fans of Blue Note's avant-garde to track down.
